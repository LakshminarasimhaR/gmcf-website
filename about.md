  <h2>Mission</h2>
  <p>
    To drive evidence-based wildlife conservation in India and beyond—bridging the gap between <strong>in situ</strong> and <strong>ex situ</strong> approaches—so that both natural habitats and zoological institutions benefit from shared knowledge, research, and best practices.
  </p>

  <h2>Vision</h2>
  <p>
    A world where human communities and wildlife coexist harmoniously, guided by informed stewardship and sustainable management. Through data-driven strategies, long-term ecological research, and collaboration with stakeholders, we envision thriving ecosystems that support future generations.

  <h2>What We Do</h2>
  <ul class="styled-list">
    <li><strong>Promote Evidence-Based Conservation:</strong> We support wildlife conservation practices rooted in science as an essential component of safeguarding nature.</li>
    <li><strong>Advance Ex Situ Conservation:</strong> We apply and refine scientific methods for managing wild animals under human care, enhancing zoo science, and strengthening zoological institutions.</li>
    <li><strong>Collaborate & Demonstrate:</strong> Working closely with zoos and other partners, we conduct demonstration projects, offer on-site guidance, and improve overall zoo management in India.</li>
    <li><strong>Influence Policy:</strong> We engage with government agencies, advocating for data-driven, ecologically sound policies that lead to meaningful, long-term conservation outcomes.</li>
    <li><strong>Link In Situ & Ex Situ Efforts:</strong> By integrating wildlife monitoring with both field-based and zoo-based initiatives, we bridge the gap between in situ and ex situ conservation.</li>
    <li><strong>Build Capacity:</strong> We empower individuals and organizations by providing training, workshops, and technical support, enabling them to effectively study, manage, and conserve ecological systems and wildlife populations.</li>
    <li><strong>Conduct & Facilitate Research:</strong> We carry out and support research initiatives that deepen our understanding of species ecology, population trends, and the impacts of conservation interventions.</li>
